ICTACT Student Innovator Award Runner Up project in Information Technology domain

--“Not all readers are leaders…But all leaders are readers.” - Harry S. Truman. 
Dyslexia affects 10-15 % of children, many of whom remain undiagnosed. In Greek "Dys" means a difficulty with and "lexia" means with language. According to IDA (International Dyslexia Association), “Dyslexia is a specific learning disability that is neurobiological in origin”. These children suffer from difficulties like alphabet recognition, reading words and writing in mirror patterns. The existing system has taken efforts to handle interaction, letter recognition, phonological processing and visuo - spatial attention. The proposed system “MAD - Multisensory Application for Dyslexic” aims at developing a learning aid that helps the children also to overcome the Dyslexia via three sensory modalities (visual, auditory, and tactile). Dysgraphia, a part of dyslexia is a condition that causes trouble with writing expression. The proposed application mainly aims in aiding the teachers to efficiently train dyslexic children who need special attention in reading (vision and auditory) and writing (vision and graphical trait) thereby resolving the problem of “one child- one tutor”.
